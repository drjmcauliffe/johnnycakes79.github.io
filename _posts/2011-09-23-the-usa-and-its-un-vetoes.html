<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-15040556" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" class="alignnone" height="225" src="http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/55558000/jpg/_55558241_jex_1177860_de29-1.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;">"Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas has submitted his bid to the UN for recognition of a Palestinian state. Addressing the General Assembly shortly afterwards, he called on the Security Council to approve full Palestinian membership of the UN.He said the Palestinians had entered negotiations with Israel with sincere intentions, but blamed the building of Jewish settlements for their failure.Israel and the US say a Palestinian state can only be achieved through talks with Israel."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: 300;"><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-15040556">BBC News - President Abbas receives ovation at UN</a>.</span></div></blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Tonight, having watched Mahmoud Abbas ask for his people the right to self-determination, and believing with fair certainty that the United States will use its veto to block the motion, I decided to do a little online investigation of the number of times the US has used its veto in the UN. The answer?</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Lots! Over 70 since 1972 ...</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">But while the number in itself is indeed pause for thought (I didn't find a list of how many they'd not vetoed), it was the nature of the resolutions they have blocked that is truly frightening.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The one that stands out to me most is their veto of the <strong>UN call for a treaty on children's rights</strong> in 2008. Now the lawyers among you may ask if I'm familiar with the particulars of that specific resolution - I am not. But the vote was 159 to 1. Is it conceivable that 159 nations had it wrong and only the US of A had it right?</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I've taken this information from a few sites, but mostly here:&nbsp;<a href="http://goo.gl/lg2Z">KryssTal : USA Vetos in the UN</a>. Have a look at what other Global improvements the US has obstructed over the past 4 decades. But&nbsp;as the warning at the top of that website urges:</div><blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;">"Do not simply believe anything on this website - always check for yourself.
