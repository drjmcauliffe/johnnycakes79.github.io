<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
<div style="text-align: justify;">So Aer Lingus are now serving platters. At least in peasant class from Madrid to Dublin. And there's only about 13 of us on the plane. Maybe that's why...</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">They have a fruit platter, a cheese platter, a cracker and pâté platter, a pretentious platter and ... I think I'll have the give-it-a-fancy-name-so-I-don't-realize-it's-soggy-apples-and-pears-and-one-tiny-piece-of-strawberry-in-a-plastic-cup platter. When did things become so silly?</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">And when did the flight attendants - if that's still politically correct - become so grumpy? Where are the green clad smiley people that fill the in-flight magazine? The great Irish sage Tommy Tiernan once said that Irish people are happiest when we're broke. I guess the crisis hasn't hit Aer Lingus staff... yet. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Wow, €7.60 for a sandwich and a coffee. No sign of the crisis here. Granted, it's a litre and a half of coffee - but €7.60! And my poor... squished... sandwich! It looks like it has been packaged by a frustrated Ryanair passenger... <em>it'll fit... It'll fit... It... will... There! Told ya!</em>. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://watchnlearndotorg.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/20111211-211134.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="20111211-211134.jpg" class="alignnone size-full" src="http://watchnlearndotorg.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/20111211-211134.jpg" /></a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">My favourite bit of this whole adventure however is the name they've given to their little carts of goodies. <strong>The Sky Deli Cafe</strong>. Mmmmmmmm... magical. Now, if I was none the wiser and someone told me they had just had lunch in the Sky Deli Cafe, images of a chic French patisserie version of Guinness' Gravity Bar suspended from white fluffy clouds would spring to mind, and not the patronising reality of "Now!" <em>...hands clasped a la Mrs. O' Shea, first class teacher...</em> "Can I getchaz anything from d'Sky Deli Cafe?" <em>...unstated suffix: and hurry up coz I don't have all day!!!</em> I often order something simply out of fear.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">And what of the <strong>spife</strong> and the DIY or rather the CUAYCINDI* waste bag... Well, you'll just have to hop onboard the next friendly Aer Lingus flight and see for yourself. But, by the gods, make sure you've done your sums and your spelling...</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://watchnlearndotorg.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/20111211-211255.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="20111211-211255.jpg" class="alignnone size-full" src="http://watchnlearndotorg.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/20111211-211255.jpg" /></a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">*Clean Up After Yourself Coz I'm Not Doing It.</div>
